         <p>These tests gave me a better perspective of what my personality is, how I interact with other and what areas of myself I can work on, for example on the Myer-Briggs test, it showed that I am 99% turbulent which was really disappointing, and I would to try to focus more on being more assertive, and put my idea firmly into a discussion rather than agreeing and going out of my way to make someone else’s life and decision better rather than believing more on what I have to say.</p>

         <p>In a workplace scenario I would focus on auditory and visual content, to be able to retain more information as fast as possible.</p>

         <p>These tests would make me focus on being more assertive within a team, try to lead and take on more responsibilitieswithin the team at work, rather than agreeing with someone else’s idea and following it without putting my idea first, and as Jordan Peterson said there is a gap in between women and men in the workforce since men tend to be more assertive and women tend to be more agreeing which gives men a higher paying role within a company from his perspective of the work and corporate society. With that being said this would push me to work on my work behaviour with colleagues and work mates.</p>

         <p>Finally these tests are a reflection of how I see myself, which I reckon I am very agreeable and neuroticism is very high which means that I tend to focus on negative emotions including anxiety, fear and shame… I would focus on changing how I perceive myself and try to focus more on being more extraverted have better self discipline…</p>

         If I was given the task of forming a team I would like to focus on a more rational way of thinking, trying to form a team with a good balance of assertive and agreeing people, putting on people that are more and open and are more prone to interactions with customers while growing this personality side of other employees that are not as open and extroverted as others with small interactions with clients, let them interact and assert their ideas more within a group meeting …
