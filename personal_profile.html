         These tests would make me focus on being more assertive within a team, try to lead and take on more responsibilities within the team at work, rather than agreeing with someone else’s idea and following it without putting my idea first, and as Jordan Peterson said there is a gap in between women and men in the workforce since men tend to be more assertive and women tend to be more agreeing which gives men a higher paying role within a company from his perspective of the work and corporate society. With that being said this would push me to work on my work behaviour with colleagues and work mates.
