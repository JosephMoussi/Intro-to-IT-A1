    <h2>
        Personal information
    </h2>

        <p>I am Joseph Elie Moussi, an Australian/Greek/Lebanese 20 year old who loves his ethnical background, I used to live in between Greece and Lebanon for the past 10 years before moving back to Australia again after covid hit. I undertook my VCE with an economic stream for my year 12 at a French school from the academy of Paris, and I studied for 3 semesters the bachelor of software engineering before enrolling into the bachelor of IT that I am currently undertaking. I can fluently read and write 5 languages which are: English(obviously), French, Greek, Arabic and Turkish, it may seem a lot but living in multiple countries will force someone to learn their language to be able to communicate better and to connect with the culture of the place as well</p>

    <h2> Fun facts about me</h2>
   <ul>
       <li> I love politics, and economics and every time I meet someone I tend to ask them what’s their background and try to learn about their culture as much as I can.</li>
       <li>Ive got a pet cat and her name is Tully and this is a picture of her(include picture), she’s my 4th pet after having 3 birds as previous pets.
    </li>
   </ul>

     <h2>
       Interest in IT
     </h2>

     <p>
       From a very young age the internet sparked my curiosity and made me question how was it possible to communicate with my family in Australia while being on the other side of the globe in Greece. Internet speeds were always an area of interest for me and the different types of technologies always triggered my interest and how were houses connected to the internet and how is my phone connected while not being home, all these questions were running thru my mind every time I used an electronic device. When I was 17 years old, my uncle who is in Melbourne, introduced me to his job and shared his ambitions within the tech world. He used work for IBM and Telstra and is currently working for AIA insurance as a senior software tester, and is part of the recruiting team for the tech department of the company. He is also currently working on his tech startup with some developers from across Asia and Australia, and I got the chance to join a group meeting which was a weekly catch up on how everything is going with the developers and I was exposed to how a tech company functions and what developers do and I guess I really like it and here I am enrolled in the bachelor of IT.
     </p>
     <p>
       I chose RMIT as my first uni of choice since, it known for it’s leading industry connections and graduates would be job ready when they graduate thanks to RMIT’s different teaching model that is not traditional, but innovative and RMIT’s courses offer more hands one experience and exposer unlike other university and higher education institutions.
     </p>
     <p>
       In terms of this course in particular I am looking forward to learn the different aspects of the IT world moreover I believe that this degree would expose me to more information and I would gain more knowledge about IT systems, since after studying the bachelor of software engineering which showed me the coding side of the IT world, I am more interested in the technical, infrastructural and real life IT such as networking… which are my expectations of this course, as well as the coding side of the IT world.
