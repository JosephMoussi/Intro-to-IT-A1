    <h2>
        Personal information
    </h2>

        <p>I am Joseph Elie Moussi, an Australian/Greek/Lebanese 20 year old who loves his ethnical background, I used to live in between Greece and Lebanon for the past 10 years before moving back to Australia again after covid hit. I undertook my VCE with an economic stream for my year 12 at a French school from the academy of Paris, and I studied for 3 semesters the bachelor of software engineering before enrolling into the bachelor of IT that I am currently undertaking. I can fluently read and write 5 languages which are: English(obviously), French, Greek, Arabic and Turkish, it may seem a lot but living in multiple countries will force someone to learn their language to be able to communicate better and to connect with the culture of the place as well</p>

    <h2> Fun facts about me</h2>
   <ul>
       <li> I love politics, and economics and every time I meet someone I tend to ask them what’s their background and try to learn about their culture as much as I can.</li>
       <li>Ive got a pet cat and her name is Tully and this is a picture of her(include picture), she’s my 4th pet after having 3 birds as previous pets.
    </li>
   </ul>
