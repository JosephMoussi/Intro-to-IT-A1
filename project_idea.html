     <h1>Project Idea</h1>
     <h2>Overview:</h2>
     <p>The main idea of then project would be a software that would help startup companies that deal better with warehousing and stock, manage their stock live, seeing how much stock they’ve got left and how they are dealing with supply and demand. The software would have some intelligence to predict how much demand would be expected in each season, and how much the company should order stock based on previous customer behaviour (Number of times the website has been visited, the items that are ordered the most, the amount of people that checkout their carts and the most added items to the shopping cart). This software would have an assistant that the company can communicate with using their voices same thing as interacting with a google assistant and Siri.</p>

     <h2>Motivation</h2>
     <p>This project would help startups that are struggling with funding, and it would help big companies too manage their stocks in a more efficient way. Maybe this project idea would get help from the Australian government for the funding since Australia is the nerve centre of the Oceania startup ecosystem, and there more than 17,000 startups a year are emerging from Australia alone, with more than 2,300 public ones. In 2021 there was 839,978 companies that are less than 1 year old. Moreover 1 in 3 startups fail in Australia on average and this software would help these startups to save on one aspect to be able to invest in other parts of the company by making this software as affordable as possible and as efficient as possible.
     </p>

     <h2>Description:</h2>
     <p>For the project it would have an interface that is very user friendly and that is connected to the database on a live basis to check how the stock is going and how much stock is coming in, and how much is going out,  and how much is being used in production. Moreover upon user request it would show some graphs and diagrams concerning future predictions of the stock, while not overwhelming the user with a lot of non-understandable numbers and percentages. The webpage would be accessible with a desktop device such as a laptop or computer, with tablets, and phones for it to be more convenient, many users can have a look at the website at the same time but if someone is making any changes or is asking to assistant to make some changes then it would only be available for one person at a time so the changes wouldn’t overlap and to avoid mistakes with ordering for example etc… If the user would allow it the software would place orders automatically on a recurring basis ( for example, monthly, fortnightly, quarterly … ) from different providers for different products based on what the company needs at the current state. It would update the stock after the user updates its database system. With that being said, the stock has to be updated at the warehouse whenever a delivery would come in, whenever the company is using the product or whenever products are being sold individually. Furthermore the database would allow the user to add faulty products, that can help the company get better with knowing how efficient the production is, and they can improve it based on comparing their actual month with an average of previous months, and they can add faulty products from different providers that they ordered so they can keep track when it comes to asking for returns or reimbursement as well.  In regards to the virtual assistant the user can talk to her and ask her for example how much stock of X items does the user have and the assistant would fetch the data from the database and would respond to the user with an accurate number. In addition the software can compare the actual stock that is available compared to what is recommended based on the demand. With that being said  Moreover with the virtual assistant the user can ask her to tell him about the predictions that the software has made and it would respond to the user according to what is asked </p>

     <h2>Skills Required:</h2>
     <p>The skills required from the project would be a good understanding and proficiency  of the python language as well as a good foundation and proficiency on DBMS language for the software systems. In addiction some knowledge about AI is needed to able to master the virtual assistant and its responsiveness. A major hurdle is the economic and financial side of the project since we need someone who knows how to analyse markets, orders and number to be able to build algorithms to predict the number of items needed etc…
     </p>

     <h2>Outcome:</h2>
     <p>If this project is successful, it would solve the original problem of companies having to struggle with their current stock managing system, and would make it easier for smaller startups and small companies to be able to access a better software that would reduce costs and make it more efficient having the assistance of a virtual assistant that can help with forecasting and future prediction of sales and would solve the problem of smaller companies not being able to access a market of goof software buy making our software more affordable and more accessible while being as efficient as possible.</p>
