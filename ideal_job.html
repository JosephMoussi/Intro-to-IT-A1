         <p>As of now my ideal job would be working in networking since I love the technical
           aspect of it and the real world version of IT, what happens in between the devices
           and how they are connected to the internet.</p>

           <p>One of my passions is to make devices,
           homes, offices, smarter using IoT, and having a good connection and a great network
           would be a crucial foundation to her able to make any space smarter,
           hence my desire to work as a senior network engineer at a big tech firm,
           and this Job advertisement grabbed my attention since working for
           the world’s 6th largest IT company by revenue would be a major step
           in my carrier, which needs a lot of hard work and dedication,
           Fujitsu is a company that I known for its ambition to make people’s
           lives easier and better and most definitely smarter, having more than “130 000 employees helping customers in more than 180 countries”, (About Fujitsu : Fujitsu Global, 2022).</p>

            <p>This Job position
            is a full time position to be a network engineer in Canberra for Fujitsu Australia that
            mostly focuses on implementing, managing and planning network communications systems (voice and Data) (Fujitsu Technology & Service Vision 2022 latest version, 2022). Conduct testing of network design, maintain technical expertise in all areas of network and computer hardware and software interconnection and interfacing, which is what excites me in terms of IT.
            This Job itself does not require a specific number of degrees or experience, but it requires candidates to have a tertiary qualification in a relevant discipline such as the bachelor of IT that I am currently undertaking, high level of experience and knowledge in network related subjects and hardware such as Cisco products, WAN technologies, Juniper and encryption technologies etc…
            Studying the bachelor of IT at RMIT will be a big step to getting closer to the requirements of this role, and I would take more classes related t networking if possible in my degree so I would be exposed to more content and gain more knowledge about networking, moreover I would do my own research and enrol in bootcamps if possible related to networking to be able to get more experience on the subject. </p>
